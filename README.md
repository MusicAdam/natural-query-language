PURPOSE
Natural Query Language is a simple boolean predicate language which 
enables LLMs to reliably convert natural language into a parseable query language. NQL's purpose 
is not to do querying itself, but to be a domain-independent query language, intended to be parsed
into a target language for actual domain specific data querying, such as MySQL or ElasticSearch.

The goal is to enable 100% reliability for use with general LLMs, allowing general implementation
of Natural Language Query for machine learning laymen.
